Summary and Plot of the Fund For Peace 2013 Index
========================================================

This are my first steps on R markdown language, so I will show an arbitrary plot and summary of a dataset related to political science.


### The Fund for Peace Failed States Index 2013

```{r}
ffpfsi13 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/ffpfsi13.csv", sep=";", dec=",")
summary(ffpfsi13)
```

## The following plot will show a correlation between the amount of Refugees and the total of the Failed States Index:

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
FailedStates<-subset(ffpfsi13, Total >= 90)
plot(FailedStates$Total, FailedStates$Refugees.and.IDPs)
```
