Summary and Plot of the SWISS standard dataset
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Here is a standard dataset of R


```{r}
ffpfsi13 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/ffpfsi13.csv", sep=";", dec=",")
summary(ffpfsi13)
```

## You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
FailedStates<-subset(ffpfsi13, Total >= 90)
plot(FailedStates$Total, FailedStates$Refugees.and.IDPs)
```
